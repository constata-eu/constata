    The Bitcoin network, which operates the database where <b>CONSTATA</b> writes the data that allows validating the timestamps issued, is a decentralized network that never loses its characteristics of immutability and availability, but sometimes it takes longer than expected to accept that write new data. <b>CONSTATA</b> makes its best efforts to be able to write to this database every one to three hours, but unexpected network conditions may take longer to write a timestamp to it. However, between the receipt of a document and its time stamp using the Bitcoin blockchain, the documents have a receipt date in the <b>CONSTATA system.</b>, which may have less probative value.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>CONSTATA</b> is not responsible for technical failures due to fortuitous causes, force majeure, or of another nature that are not attributable to it and prevent the normal operation of the service through the communication channels and the API.

  <h2 id="section_anexo_1">Annex I: Description of trust services.</h2>
  <h3 id="servic_timestamp" class="font-weight-bold">Service: Bitcoin Blockchain Time Stamp.</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of <b>CONSTATA</b> 's Time Stamp service is to generate irrefutable proof about the date from which a document exists, and that its integrity was not violated from the moment it received the time stamp. This service is charged at the rate of 1 token for each MB that the file weighs, with a minimum fraction of 1 MB.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a <b>USER</b> sends a document to <b>CONSTATA</b> to be stamped, <b>CONSTATA</b> calculates one or more digital fingerprints (hashes, calculated with the sha256 algorithm), and adds them to a self-made bulletin with a periodicity of between one and three hours. If the hash of a document is written to a bulletin, and the hash of the bulletin is written to the Bitcoin blockchain, it can be proven that the document has existed since at least the date the data was written to the Bitcoin blockchain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the time stamp has been applied, the <b>USER</b> is provided with a digital certificate, called <b>a time stamp certificate,</b> which contains the sealed documents, the bulletin, the identifier of the transaction in the Bitcoin network where it was registered, and the algorithm that allows it to be validated. . This <b>certificate</b> can be transmitted and stored by the <b>USER</b> by any means, and validated by third parties that receive it, without requiring active intervention by <b>CONSTATA</b> for its validation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time stamp service includes storage of the sealed document for a period of 5 years, which can be extended at the user's request.
  </p>
  <p>
    The delivery channel of the <b>time stamp certificate</b> will be the same one used to transmit the documents, either as an attachment or through a unique direct download link. In the case of receiving a direct download link, it is the entire responsibility of the <b>USER</b> not to disclose it to third parties that they do not want to access the <b>certificate</b> and its documents. It is possible that the <b>time stamp certificate</b> may also be delivered by alternative means, at the request of the <b>USER</b> .
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>time stamp certificate</b> is a file in HTML format that can be viewed in a desktop web browser. It acts as a file cabinet for the documents that were sealed and also allows the viewing or extraction of those original documents. <b>Every time the certificate</b> is opened , the validation algorithm is executed in real time.
  </p>
  <p>
    To verify the integrity of the algorithm, <b>CONSTATA</b> signs all the <b>certificates</b> it issues. In addition, said signature can be validated by any recipient of the <b>certificate</b> using the tool available at https://constata.eu without the need for said recipient to register, or ask <b>CONSTATA</b> for permission to do so. The signature validation tool runs on the user's computer, and never sends or receives <b>CONSTATA</b> data .
  </p>
  <p>
    In cases where there are documents that correlate with each other, for example messages and responses deferred in time, or a document that modifies a previous one, <b>CONSTATA</b> can produce a <b>time stamp certificate</b> containing said documents that serves as a record of the themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the <b>USER</b> also has the electronic signature service active, the <b>time stamp certificates</b> will contain the clarifications related to the validations that <b>CONSTATA</b> has carried out on the data of the signatory. For more information consult the <a href="#service_signature">electronic signatures and seals</a> service .
  </p>
  <h4>Modality via Email.</h4>
  <p>
    Anyone can write an email to <a href="mailto:ace@constata.eu">ace@constata.eu</a> so that it receives a time stamp, as well as all the attachments it contains. If the mail is sent or copied to third parties, our additional <a href="#service_notification">electronic notification</a> service is automatically activated .
  </p>
  <p><b>CONSTATA</b> 
    's virtual assistant responds by means of an email with acknowledgment of receipt and registers the sender as a <b>USER</b> . Said email contains the instructions to accept the terms and conditions, and purchase the necessary tokens to use the service. <b>CONSTATA</b> can make a total or partial bonus of the tokens.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the <b>USER</b> accepts the terms and conditions, and has the necessary tokens, <b>CONSTATA</b> applies the timestamp to the email and all its attachments and sends a new email to the <b>USER</b> containing the timestamp <b>certificate</b> . If, due to the size of the certificate, <b>CONSTATA</b> considers it inconvenient to send it as an attachment, a download link will be sent to the <b>USER . </b><b>It is the USER</b> 's responsibility to keep the download link private and not disclose it to people who should not access the certificate.
  </p>
  <h4>Modality via API.</h4>
  <p>
    The <b>USER</b> can download the <b>CONSTATA</b> SDK and our command line tool from the links available on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first execution of our command line tool, a private key will be generated on the <b>USER</b> 's computer to be used as a digital signature with the ECDSA SECP256k1 algorithm. This algorithm is the same one used by Bitcoin wallets to sign transactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    This private key is stored in the <b>USER</b> 's computer and is never transmitted to <b>CONSTATA</b> . In addition, the private key is encrypted with a password that the <b>USER</b> must provide so that the command line tool can decrypt said key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using our API you can send documents to <b>CONSTATA</b> to be time-stamped, consult the previously sealed documents, the <b>USER</b> 's account statement and download the <b>time-stamped certificates</b> . <b>CONSTATA</b> may also be required to provide the electronic signature or electronic seal service in its Website validation variant.
  </p>
  <p>
    If any payment is required to continue processing the documents, a link with payment instructions
   will be included in the <b>CONSTATA API response.</b></p>
  <p>
    Requests to the <b>CONSTATA</b> API will be digitally signed with the private key of the <b>USER</b> , who is responsible for keeping the backup copies thereof. The <b>time stamp certificates</b> will show the public key, with which the documents sent to <b>CONSTATA</b> were signed , in a similar way to the validations of the electronic signature and electronic seal service.
  </p>
  <h4>Modality via web application.</h4>
  <p>Through the Constata web application users will have to register and obtain their user. Once this step is completed, they can use the tool to issue serial certificates through a standard template provided by the application or upload their own template. The purpose for which this application was created refers to the sending of diplomas, badges and certificates of attendance to congresses, webinars, etc.
     The certificates via CONSTATA's web application will be digitally signed with the USER's private key and the USER is responsible for keeping backup copies of it. The time stamp certificates will show the public key, with which the documents sent to CONSTATA were signed, in a similar way as the validations of the electronic signature and electronic seal service described in the following points are shown.
     In addition, the certificates will be notified to the e-mails indicated by the user in the Constata web application.</p>

  <h4>On the validity and durability in the Bitcoin blockchain.</h4>
  <p>
    The <b>CONSTATA</b> time stamp uses the Bitcoin blockchain for its ability to sequence records and set a certain date, for its immutability characteristics, and for its distributed availability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain is ensured by the proof-of-work algorithm, and the amount of resources (electric power, attention, and independent investment) allocated by those who perform that proof-of-work. It is prohibitively expensive for any centralized agent to attempt to erase or modify Bitcoin blockchain data, and this can be independently validated by any network participant, nullifying the attack vector of any malicious intermediary.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the Bitcoin blockchain has numerous copies managed by third parties that can be easily queried, copied, and validated independently, there are plenty of ways in which any auditor can get hold of a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application of the time stamp to a document with the <b>CONSTATA</b> mechanism can be delayed since the <b>USER</b> requests the stamp. However, the certification provided by <b>CONSTATA</b> is dated accurately to the second. The delay depends on how long <b>CONSTATA</b> takes to validate that exact date in the Bitcoin network.
  </p>
  <h3 id="service_signature" class="font-weight-bold">Service: Electronic signature and Electronic stamp.</h3>
  <p>
    The electronic signature and electronic seal services aim to establish the veracity of the data of the CONSTATA <b>USER </b><b>who</b> applies a time stamp on its platform. To activate the service, the <b>USER</b> requires <b>CONSTATA</b> to carry out the relevant validations. <b>CONSTATA</b> produces these validations, and saves your evidence with a time stamp.
  <b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b></p>
  <p>
    Once the validations have been carried out, all the <b>time stamp certificates</b> issued to the <b>USER</b> will have a special <b>CONSTATA</b> legend , accounting for the data that <b>CONSTATA</b> has been able to certify about the signing
   <b>USER .</b></p>
  <p>
    The cost of the service depends on the weight in megabytes of the evidence collected and certified by <b>CONSTATA</b> , at the rate of 1 token per megabyte of evidence. This service will be 100% discounted unless <b>CONSTATA</b> indicates otherwise at the time the <b>USER</b> requires the service.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>CONSTATA</b> can certify different data of the <b>USER</b> over time. These updated data will be incorporated into all subsequent <b>time stamp certificates</b> automatically, and may also be incorporated into previous <b>time stamp certificates</b> at the request of the <b>USER .</b>
  </p>
  <h4>Website verification.</h4>
  <p>
    The <b>USER</b> using the command line tool and the <b>CONSTATA</b> API may request to be verified as an administrator of a website.
  </p>
  <p><b>CONSTATA</b> 
    then requires the <b>USER</b> to sign a message defined by <b>CONSTATA</b> for this validation, and proceed to publish it to an address on their website established by <b>CONSTATA</b> .
  </p>
  <p>
    When <b>CONSTATA</b> observes the correctly signed message on the <b>USER</b> 's website, it saves the web traffic resulting from the observation as evidence and applies a time stamp to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    From that moment, <b>CONSTATA</b> verifies that the <b>USER</b> is the administrator of the website, and all <b>time stamp certificates</b> issued for that <b>USER</b> will have the legend, in order to explain this validation, "Web: We verify that the signatory administers the web [website address]".
  </p>
  <h4>Verification of user data.</h4>
  <p>
    <b>CONSTATA</b> verifies the <b>USER</b> 's data and their ability to act on their own behalf and that of a company, associating them with other previously obtained data such as their email address and API public key.
  </p>
  <p>
    This service is provided at the request of the <b>USER</b> or through a customized service contract between <b>CONSTATA</b> and the <b>USER .</b>
  </p>
  <p>
To carry out these verifications , <b>CONSTATA</b> will require the <b>USER</b> to submit forms with personal data, images of their identity document, proof of address, and if they are going to be acting on behalf of a company, the updated statutes of their company, and powers of attorney or acts of appointment that allows him to act on his behalf. <b>CONSTATA</b> will also carry out a telematic biometric process through a video call or similar technology, in which the consent and acceptance of the process by the <b>USER</b> will be established, in addition to ratifying the data provided above.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of verification and analysis of this data will be carried out by <b>CONSTATA</b> personnel , who will be assisted by public databases and special software that allows fraud to be avoided. Upon successful completion of this process, <b>CONSTATA</b> will apply a time stamp to all the documents and means that appear in the verification file.
  </p>
  <p>
    From that moment on, all <b>time stamp certificates</b> issued by that <b>USER</b> will have the legend in order to explain the validation carried out: "We verify that the signer is [Name, Surname, identification number, Year of birth, Nationality, Country of residence] and acts as [Title or position within the company, company name, country of company, state company registration number, tax identification number]".
  </p>
  <h2 id="section_anexo_2">Annex II: Other services.</h2>
  <h3 id="service_notification" class="font-weight-bold">Service: Electronic notification.</h3>
  <p>
  Through the Electronic Notification service, <b>CONSTATA</b> certifies that an issuer has completed the necessary procedures to contact one or more recipients. To use the service, the issuer writes an email and adds CONSTATA's virtual assistant <a href="mailto:ace@constata.eu">ace@constata.eu </a><b>in</b>  a copy of it (in the To, CC, BCC fields).
  <a href="mailto:ace@constata.eu"></a></p>
  <p>
    <b>CONSTATA</b> applies a timestamp to the RAW version of the email, thus crediting the content and all the headers of the email, which includes the other recipients of the email and the information of the email servers that processed the message.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the time stamp is applied to the mail, the sender receives a <b>time stamp certificate</b> that contains the mail in RAW format, and each section of the mail separately.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the <b>USER</b> issuing the notification has activated the electronic signature or electronic stamp service associated with their email address, the certificate will also be electronically signed by the <b>USER</b> , including the legend corresponding to the verifications that <b>CONSTATA</b> has carried out .
  </p>
  <p>
  The electronic notification service is similar to the time stamp service when it is provided by email. In this case, the email has other recipients besides <a href="mailto:ace@constata.eu">ace@constata.eu</a> . The time-stamped mail is the proof of the electronic notification, and it is kept for 5 years, with a cost of 1 token for each megabyte of weight.
  </p>
  <p><b>As current technology does not have reliable mechanisms to reliably certify the opening, reading, and understanding of the mail by its recipients, CONSTATA</b> 
    's electronic notification is limited to verifying the procedures carried out by the <b>USER</b> when sending the mail.
