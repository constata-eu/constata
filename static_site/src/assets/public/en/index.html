        Shifting Our Focus to the Foundations
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our mission to help shape the post-Bitcoin society and economy is taking us in a new direction: building basic
        infrastructure and services for projects that we believe are even more valuable than our diploma-issuance app.
      </p>
      <p>
        We poured a lot of love and effort into this service, and while weâ€™re no longer developing it, it will remain
        available in read-only mode. All cert/ificates will continue to be verifiable here for the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        But before we can rebuild certification authorities on Bitcoin, the foundation has to be laid: robust sovereign
        computing platforms, publicly accessible financial instruments, and transparent institutions that replace costly
        bureaucracy and gatekeeping with clear rules, software protections, and open, directly democratic communities.
