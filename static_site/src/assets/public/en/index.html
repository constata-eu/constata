      <h2>A novel format.</h2>
      <p>
        Our diplomas are issued in a <strong>verifiable HTML format</strong>
        that can be viewed and verified from any browser, without installing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are <strong>timestamped</strong> on the Bitcoin blockchain and <strong>electronically signed</strong> by your company — they are more secure and versatile than paper diplomas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our custom designs <strong>protect your brand</strong> on all screen sizes and allow you to <strong>attach other documents</strong> such as academic history, audio, video, and photos.
      </p>
      <p>
        And they are not just diplomas — they can be <strong>attendance certificates</strong> or <strong>badges</strong>.

      <div>
        <h4>Also adds value to official titles.</h4>
        <p>
          Official education degrees are only issued by an <strong>official entity</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are required from the student by the public administration and other official bodies of the same country &mdash;
          but often <strong>they are not easy to present and verify in the private sector</strong>, especially in other countries.
        <p>
        <p>
          An approved official title <strong>can be attached to the diploma issued by Constata</strong>,
          providing it with the advantages of management, dissemination, and quick verification, without losing the possibility of official verification.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>We don't advertise on your diplomas.</h4>
        <p>
          The issuance of diplomas can achieve a lot of publicity, you can use them to advertise your company &mdash; as long as your students approve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constata only appears as a third-party to facilitate verification.  We do not sell your students' data or attention. We will never send them any kind of commercial offers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>We work in Europe and Latin America.</h4>
        <p>Our team is distributed in several cities in Spain and Argentina.</p>
        <p>
          Due to geographical and political affinity, we develop our solution by observing European regulations and the idiosyncrasies of Latin America.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>The generated signature only works on Constata.</h4>
        <p>
          You can take your Constata digital signature to another device, just by copying the
          <strong>firma.json</strong> file that is generated when you register and start
          using the web application from there &mdash; without installing or configuring anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means that <strong>you cannot use another digital signature</strong>
          from another provider to issue diplomas.
        </p>
        <p>
          This limitation is not as bad as it sounds, it is a good idea to use
          different signatures for different areas.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>We are computer technicians and lawyers.</h4>
        <p>We have experience as educators, in technology and data regulation, and have been using bitcoin since 2011.</p>
        <p>This fusion of experiences and abilities gives us a unique perspective on data integrity and legal validity.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>We do not offer a visual diploma editor.</h4>
        <p>
          Capturing the identity of an institution in a functional diploma is an art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual editors are inflexible, or burden your team with work, with below average results.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer a complete solution &mdash; and if there are digital artists on your team, we can work with them.
